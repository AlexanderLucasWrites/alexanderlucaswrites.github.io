title: Monthly Update - June 2024
---

I'm about 44k words into my first draft with about 13k words written this month! I'm super happy with my progress so far.

I managed to draft the rest of chapter 1 like I'd planned last month, but I also have most of act 1 written out. As for what's missing, I have one scene early on that I haven't figured out. There're also two chapters at the very end that're missing some of the connecting scenes. I hope to have those finished by the end of June, though.

Since this isn't a lot of stuff, I'll probably just continue into act 2 afterwards. Hopefully I can get a good chunk of it finished. Generally I'd love to be done with the first draft by the end of the year. At the current pace I should be able to get there sometime this fall.
