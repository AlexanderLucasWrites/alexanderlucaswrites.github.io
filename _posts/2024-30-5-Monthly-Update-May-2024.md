Right now I'm about 30.7k words into my first draft with roughly 6k written this month.

After starting out late last year I didn't do much during the winter and only really got back into it this month. I'm generally pretty happy with my progress, although it's been spread out across a few different parts of the story. Right now it's mostly bits and pieces of scenes with most of the connecting tissue missing. 

My goal for next month is to work on the first chapter and hopefully link up the existing scenes.
