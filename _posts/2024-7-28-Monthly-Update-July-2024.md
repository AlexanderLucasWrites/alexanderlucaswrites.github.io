title: Monthly Update - July 2024
---

I'm about 61k words into the first draft with about 17k (holy shit) words written this month!

I managed to finish a big chunk of the second act, although it's still missing a couple of scenes. Getting on with those is on my todo list for august.

I also started on act 3, although that was a bit tricky. I had some old drafts from a year or so in there that simply didn't match the way the rest of the story had changed anymore. After cutting those I also reworked my outline for the climax sequence a lot. In the original plan the protagonist had to take part in a ritual for lore reasons and later on got ambushed and captured. That felt like he'd end up far too passive, considering it's the climax of his story. Now the protagonist and his friends decide to take things into their own hands and it's their actions that ultimately cause the climax to start. I also changed the ambush scene into something that'd give the protagonist a lot more agency. 

The other significant change to my outline was how I want to handle the story's second PoV character. I had an arc planned out and partly written for her, but it just wouldn't work as well as I hoped. There was also a leap in logic towards the end that *worked*, but felt somewhat cheap and not entirely in character to me. Because of that I decided to swap her role for that of a different character and give her character arc (and the main antagonist) an entirely different ending.

My plans for August are to get through as much of the climax and the remaining scenes of act 2 as I can. I also hope to map out the missing details for the second PoV, but that part of the story is significantly shorter and shouldn't be much work (plus parts are already done). If everything works, I should hopefully have the first draft done in September.
